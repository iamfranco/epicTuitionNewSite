        Welcome to Epic Tuition
      </div>
      <p>Our service is set up to nurture your child and to push them to unlock their full potential which the current system may fail to do. We recognise that even the most gifted of students could be let down by a system they have no control over whether it be because of the size of the class, the teacher not having enough time to focus on the needs of each child or simply because the current curriculum is not challenging enough. This is where we come in, our lessons are fully structured around the personal capabilities of each child; focusing on mathematics, english and an introduction to scientific concepts through fun and hands on experiments.</p>
