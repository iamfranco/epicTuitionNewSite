            Hi, I’m currently working as a maths support staff for 2 different high schools in Manchester. I have always enjoyed explaining concepts to other people, especially maths as I believe it is the most useful subject you study in school. It is the first GCSE all employers look at as it shows clear logical thinking, problem solving and an ability to think for yourself. It gives me great reward when someone comes to me with something they don’t understand and in 10 minutes they can answer nearly any question on that topic. I’m looking forward to helping you get fantastic results!

            I’m a third year physics student at the University of Manchester. I’m very passionate about physics, maths and computing. My A-level results are as follows (please note I sat my A-levels before the A* grade was available): Maths [A] Physics [A] Computing [A] AS Further Maths [A] AS Music Technology [A] I really enjoy helping students to develop their mathematical understanding and nothing pleases me more than seeing my students go on to succeed in their exams.

            I am currently in my third year of a PhD in Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Manchester, and achieved a first class degree in physics with astrophysics from Durham University . I currently help teach first year physics at the University and have experience in GCSE maths mentoring. My PhD investigates the problem of dark energy in the Universe, trying to find out what it actually is. This is done by writing computer simulations of the Universe at different time intervals to see how it has changed over time. In my spare time I like to go cycling (both road and mountain biking) and head down to the local indoor ski slope.

            I am a working towards a PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Manchester. I study the interactions of mesons and baryons using an effective theory known as chiral perturbation theory. The "chiral" bit means that we assume that left- and right-handed quarks do not interact (chiral symmetry), and the "perturbation theory" bit means that the equations can so far only be solved approximately, so we use Feynman diagrams to calculate results, with more Feynman diagrams giving us a better answer. I also enjoy mountain biking (where I often fall off), skiing (where I have broken several bones) and reading (where I am yet to injure myself). I look forward to sharing my Physics and Maths knowledge with you!

            Hello, I’m Abbie and I’m studying English Literature and German at The University of Manchester. I’ve grown up in Manchester and did my A-levels in Oldham. I absolutely love literature and language but I can completely understand how frustrating it can be to revise those kinds of things for exams, however, I’ve picked up some good tricks along the way! In my degree I study books from the medieval times to the modern day so I can help with a wide range of texts. I also study linguistics and creative writing as part of my course so language and literature analysis is what I do best.

            Hi, I’m studying Biomedical Sciences at The University of Manchester, where I’m also learning German. I’ve grown up in Manchester and did my A-levels in Oldham. When I’m not at uni, I like to go out in Manchester or play guitar. I really enjoy teaching, which is why I also teach English as a volunteer to parents with limited English ability. I finished my A-levels only a few years ago and know how hard they can be but also how to survive them and leave with decent grades. I look forward to helping with any problems you might have, so you can get yourself through these exams with the grades you want.

          <div class="tutorQuote d-none d-md-block">
            I’m studying Chemistry at the University of Manchester. I grew up in south-east London, went to a girls’ grammar school and got A*AA in my A levels. Most of my time, however, was spent doing athletics (sprint hurdles), for almost 6 years. I even coached the up and coming generation. Near to the exams we even used to desperately revise in the stands between races. I find chemistry incredibly interesting, so with my lessons I try to be as enthusiastic as possible and help people understand why it’s not just madness. I completely understand how stressful and hard exams can be (especially if you’re trying to balance the rest of your life at the same time) but I also know, from experience, that it’s not impossible! I want to help you through these stressful times to the best of my abilities.
